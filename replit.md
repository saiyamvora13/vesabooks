# AI Storybook Builder

## Overview

AI Storybook Builder is a web application that enables users to create personalized, illustrated children's storybooks using AI technology. Users provide a story prompt and 1-5 inspiration images, and the system generates a complete 6-page storybook with custom illustrations matching the style of the provided images. The platform is powered by Google Gemini AI for both story generation and image creation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives for accessible component library
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Component-based UI**: Leverages reusable Shadcn components (Button, Card, Dialog, Form, etc.) for consistent design language
- **Custom theming**: Uses CSS variables for colors with light/dark mode support, featuring a playful color palette (primary purple, secondary orange, accent blue)
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints handled through Tailwind
- **Form validation**: React Hook Form with Zod schemas for type-safe form handling
- **File handling**: Custom FileUpload component with drag-and-drop support, validation for image types (JPEG/PNG) and size limits (10MB max, 5 files max)

**Routing Structure:**
- `/` - Home page with hero, features, and examples sections
- `/create` - Story creation form with image upload and prompt input (requires authentication)
- `/library` - Personal library showing all user's storybooks (requires authentication)
- `/view/:id` - View storybook by ID
- `/shared/:shareUrl` - View storybook via share URL

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js with Express.js server
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL database operations
- In-memory storage fallback (MemStorage) for development

**Server Design Patterns:**
- **Middleware chain**: JSON parsing, request logging with response time tracking
- **Route organization**: Centralized route registration in `server/routes.ts`
- **Error handling**: Validates file types and sizes before processing
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time generation progress updates via polling mechanism
- **Session-based generation**: Uses UUID sessions to track multi-step story generation

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/storybooks` - Create new storybook (multipart/form-data for image uploads, requires authentication)
- `GET /api/storybooks` - Retrieve all storybooks for authenticated user
- `GET /api/storybooks/:id` - Retrieve storybook by ID
- `GET /api/shared/:shareUrl` - Retrieve storybook by share URL
- `POST /api/storybooks/:id/share` - Generate shareable URL
- `GET /api/storybooks/:id/epub` - Download storybook as EPUB e-book file
- `GET /api/storage/:filename` - Serve images from Replit Object Storage
- `GET /api/generation/:sessionId/progress` - Poll generation progress
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current authenticated user
- `GET /api/login` - Initiate OAuth login flow
- `GET /api/logout` - Logout and clear session

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL via Drizzle):**
- **users table**: Stores authenticated user data
  - `id` (varchar, primary key) - OAuth subject claim
  - `email` (varchar, unique)
  - `first_name` (varchar, nullable)
  - `last_name` (varchar, nullable)
  - `profile_image_url` (varchar, nullable)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  
- **storybooks table**: Stores complete storybook data
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (varchar, foreign key to users.id, ON DELETE CASCADE)
  - `title` (text)
  - `prompt` (text)
  - `pages` (JSON array of page objects with pageNumber, text, imageUrl)
  - `inspiration_images` (JSON array of image filenames)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `share_url` (text, nullable)
  
- **sessions table**: Stores user sessions for authentication
  - PostgreSQL session store via connect-pg-simple

**Storage Strategy:**
- Primary: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless driver
- Fallback: In-memory Map-based storage for development (MemStorage class)
- File uploads: Multer receives multipart uploads â†’ images saved to Replit Object Storage
- Image storage: Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud Storage backend) for persistence across server restarts
- Progress tracking: Separate in-memory Map for generation progress states

**Data Validation:**
- Zod schemas for runtime validation (createStorybookSchema, insertStorybookSchema)
- Type inference from Drizzle schemas for compile-time safety

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

### Replit Object Storage Migration (LATEST - October 8, 2025)
- **Persistent Image Storage**: Migrated all storybook images from local filesystem to Replit Object Storage (Google Cloud Storage backend)
- **Server Restart Resilience**: Images now persist across server restarts and deployments
- **Migration Completed**: Successfully migrated all 7 existing storybooks to Object Storage
- **Object Storage Service**: Created `ObjectStorageService` class for cloud storage management
- **Image Serving**: Images served via `/api/storage/{filename}` endpoint with public read access
- **EPUB Compatibility**: Updated EPUB generation to use localhost HTTP URLs (`http://localhost:5000/api/storage/...`) for image fetching
  - epub-gen-memory library requires HTTP(S) protocols, cannot use file paths
  - Images are fetched from Object Storage during EPUB generation
- **Direct Upload Pipeline**: New storybook generation uploads cover and page images directly to Object Storage
- **Legacy Support**: Maintained `/api/images` endpoint for backwards compatibility
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary local files are deleted after upload to Object Storage
- **Database Updates**: Image URLs in database updated from local paths to `/api/storage/` URLs

### EPUB E-book Download (LATEST - October 8, 2025)
- **Cross-Platform E-books**: Users can download their storybooks as EPUB files compatible with Kindle, iOS Books, Android, and other standard e-readers
- **Download Button**: "Download E-book" button added to view page next to Share button
- **Simple Clean Structure**: EPUB uses a minimalist image-first layout matching user's reference file
  - Cover page: Full-page cover image with no overlays
  - Each story page: Image on top, text paragraph below, page break after each
  - Clean typography: Georgia serif font, justified text, simple spacing
  - No page numbers, author names, or decorative elements
- **Image Packaging**: epub-gen-memory fetches images from localhost HTTP URLs and automatically packages them as embedded images inside the EPUB zip file
  - Images work offline with relative paths (e.g., `images/cover.png`)
  - 4 embedded PNG images per storybook (cover + 3 pages)
  - Uses `<img src="http://localhost:5000/api/storage/...">` which epub-gen-memory converts to embedded images
- **Professional Formatting**: Proper page breaks, font sizing (1.1rem), and 1.8 line height for optimal reading
- **Auto Naming**: Files automatically named based on story title (e.g., "magical_fox_adventure.epub")
- **Backend Service**: `server/services/epub.ts` using epub-gen-memory library
- **API Endpoint**: GET `/api/storybooks/:id/epub` with proper content-type headers
- **User Experience**: Toast notification confirms successful download, typical file size 8-10MB

### Image Style Control (October 8, 2025)
- **User-Controlled Styles**: Users can now specify their own image style in the story prompt
- **Smart Detection**: System detects 25+ style keywords (realistic, photorealistic, cartoon, anime, oil painting, watercolor, 3D, vintage, noir, cinematic, etc.)
- **Default Fallback**: If no style is specified, defaults to "vibrant and colorful children's book illustration, whimsical and gentle"
- **Adaptive Story Generation**: Story tone and structure adapt to match requested style
- **Examples**:
  - "Create a realistic photographic story about a robot" â†’ Realistic images
  - "Create a noir detective story in black and white style" â†’ Noir B&W images  
  - "Create a watercolor painting style fairy tale" â†’ Watercolor images

- **Visual Progress Bar**: Progress bar now properly fills as generation progresses (0-100%)
- **Error UI**: Clear error message displayed with retry option
- **Smart Retry**: Preserves form data (prompt + images) for seamless retry experience

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Implemented Replit Auth (OAuth) for user authentication
- Supports multiple OAuth providers: Google, GitHub, X, Apple, email/password
