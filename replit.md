# AI Storybook Builder

## Overview
AI Storybook Builder is a web application for creating personalized, AI-illustrated children's storybooks. It allows users to generate 3-page storybooks with custom illustrations by providing a story prompt and optional images. The platform leverages Google Gemini AI for both story generation and image creation, aiming to offer an engaging and customizable experience for children's literature. The project envisions an engaging and customizable platform for children's literature with market potential in personalized content.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a minimalist design with a soft white and purple color palette, supporting light/dark modes and a mobile-first approach. The storybook viewer provides a 3D flipbook experience on desktop and a single-page view with swipe gestures on mobile. User authentication supports traditional email/password and Replit Auth. A personal library manages created storybooks, and the homepage hero section dynamically showcases generated storybook covers.

**Dynamic Orientation-Based Containers**: The flipbook viewer automatically adapts its container dimensions based on each storybook's orientation (portrait/landscape/square). Square books use `vmin` units (70vmin Ã— 70vmin on mobile, 600px/700px on desktop) to maintain perfect 1:1 aspect ratios across all viewport sizes and orientations. This ensures square storybooks display in square containers, portrait books in taller containers, and landscape books in wider containers, matching the visual format of the book content.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, Shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS. The backend uses Node.js Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL, and a middleware-chain for request processing and error handling.

Key features include:
- **Admin Platform**: Dashboard for site management, including dynamic page count, pricing, hero section storybook selection, featured content curation, and audit logging.
- **Authentication**: Email/password authentication with Passport.js, bcryptjs, email validation, and session management. Secure token-based password recovery.
- **Multilingual Support (i18n)**: Internationalization for 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese Simplified) with automatic detection and persistent preferences.
- **Story Structure System**: Enforces a three-act narrative arc (beginning/middle/end) for all stories, with dynamic page distribution and continuity.
- **Character Consistency System**: Maintains visual consistency of characters across all pages using a **Progressive Visual Reference Chain** with balanced instructions for consistency and variety:
  - **Cover Image as Visual Anchor**: After generating the cover using uploaded photo references, the cover image itself is included as an additional reference for ALL subsequent images (pages, back cover)
  - **Multi-Reference Image Generation**: Each page receives BOTH the original uploaded photo(s) AND the cover image, ensuring Gemini sees the established visual appearance from the cover
  - **Text-Based Consistency**: Separates and prepends `mainCharacterDescription` and `defaultClothing` to image prompts. Clothing changes only occur when contextually required.
  - **Balanced Instructions**: Prompts guide Gemini to keep characters recognizable (age, facial features, overall look) while explicitly encouraging scene variety through different camera angles, poses, expressions, and compositions. This prevents over-consistency that can lead to repetitive imagery.
  - **Page Regeneration**: When regenerating individual pages, the system downloads both the inspiration photo(s) and cover image from Object Storage to maintain the same visual reference chain
  - This multi-layered approach ensures characters remain visually identifiable across all illustrations while allowing sufficient creative variation in scenes and compositions
- **Image Style Consistency**: Users select from 10 professional illustration styles via a dropdown selector (watercolor, digital cartoon, 3D art, vintage, kawaii, comic book, pastel, realistic, minimalist, oil painting). The selected style is consistently applied to all illustrations (cover, pages, back cover), defaulting to "vibrant and colorful children's book illustration" if not specified. The style is stored in the database for page regeneration.
- **E-Commerce System**: Integrated online store with Stripe payments, shopping cart, dual pricing (digital/print), and server-side price validation.
- **EPUB E-book Download**: Allows downloading storybooks as EPUBs with AI-generated covers (no text overlay since title/author are already in the AI-generated image), embedded illustrations, and mobile-responsive layouts.
- **Print-Ready PDF Download**: Generates professional PDFs for print orders, adhering to commercial printing specifications.
- **Prodigi Print Fulfillment**: Integrated with Prodigi Print API for physical hardcover book production and global shipping:
  - **Print Order Management**: Database table (`printOrders`) tracks Prodigi order IDs, fulfillment status, shipping details, and tracking information
  - **API Integration**: Full REST API integration with quote generation, order submission, status tracking, and webhook support for order updates
  - **Margin-Based Pricing**: Admin-adjustable markup percentage (default 20%) stored in `site_settings` table. Server-side quote endpoint applies margin to Prodigi's base cost, ensuring customers only see final customer-facing price. Prevents exposure of wholesale pricing.
  - **3-Step Print Checkout Flow**: 
    - **Step 1 - Book Options**: User selects book size (orientation-appropriate), shipping method (Budget/Standard/Express/Overnight), and destination country (8 supported countries). Real-time quote fetches and displays final price with margin applied.
    - **Step 2 - Payment**: Stripe payment processing with payment intent creation using quoted price. Race condition protection ensures payment amount matches quote.
    - **Step 3 - Shipping Address**: After successful payment, collects recipient details (name, email, phone, full address). Submits print order to Prodigi with PDF generation, Object Storage upload, and `print_orders` record creation.
  - **Book Sizes**: Supports 6 hardcover sizes - A5 Portrait/Landscape, A4 Portrait/Landscape, Square 8.3"/11.6"
  - **Security**: Zod validation for all Prodigi endpoints, webhook authentication using secret URL path (configurable via `PRODIGI_WEBHOOK_PATH_SECRET` environment variable), merchant reference validation, ownership verification for order tracking. Admin endpoint `/api/prodigi/webhook-url` provides the complete webhook URL for Prodigi dashboard configuration.
  - **Webhook Integration**: Prodigi webhooks use CloudEvents v1.0 format with `application/cloudevents+json` content type. Express JSON body parser configured to accept this content type alongside `application/json`. Webhook handler supports both CloudEvents structured format and simple Order format. All webhook logging gated by `NODE_ENV=development` to prevent sensitive data leakage in production.
  - **PDF Upload**: Automatically generates and uploads print-ready PDFs to Replit Object Storage for Prodigi access
  - **Shipping Methods**: Budget, Standard, Express, and Overnight options with real-time quote calculation
  - **Order Tracking API**: Endpoint `/api/print-orders/purchase/:purchaseId` retrieves print order details by purchase ID with ownership verification
  - **Sandbox Testing**: Uses Prodigi sandbox environment for testing without actual print production
- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanisms for generation processes and a manual "Try Again" option.
- **Persistent Image Storage**: Images are stored in Replit Object Storage with automatic optimization (JPEG compression, resized to 1200px max width) and organized in date-based folders.
- **Sample Story Prompts**: Pre-populated, admin-manageable prompts with character placeholders for user inspiration.
- **Analytics & User Insights**: Tracks story creation, completion, page regeneration, shares, and views. Provides completion rates and popular prompt analysis in the admin API.
- **Social Sharing Features**: Allows sharing storybooks on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and a public gallery for opt-in sharing with Open Graph meta tags.
- **User Feedback & Rating System**: 1-5 star rating with optional text feedback, displayed as average ratings and counts.
- **Page Regeneration**: Allows individual page regeneration for storybook owners while maintaining character and story continuity.
- **Enhanced Admin Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard showing revenue, active users, completion rates, average ratings, popular themes, and user retention metrics using Recharts.
- **Sound Effects**: Professional sound effects (book-open, page-turn) from Epidemic Sound library with volume controls and persistence. AudioManager handles deferred initialization with polling mechanism to apply persisted volume preferences after user interaction.

### Security & Monitoring
- **Security Measures**: bcryptjs for password hashing (12 salt rounds), rate limiting for authentication and password reset endpoints, secure session storage (PostgreSQL), and Zod schema validation for all API endpoints.
- **Admin Bootstrap System**: Automatic first admin user creation on server startup using environment variables. Solves the chicken-and-egg problem of creating the first admin in fresh deployment environments. Only creates admin when database has zero admin users and bootstrap environment variables are set. Required variables: `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`. Optional: `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_FIRST_NAME`, `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_LAST_NAME`.
- **Anonymous Story Creation Protection**: 
  - **IP Rate Limiting**: Anonymous users limited to 3 story creations per day per IP address, with automatic daily reset at midnight
  - **reCAPTCHA v3**: Bot protection with 0.5 minimum score threshold for anonymous story creation
  - **Email-Gated Downloads**: Anonymous storybooks require email verification (6-digit code, 15-minute expiry) before EPUB/PDF download
  - **Database Tables**: `ipRateLimits` (tracks IP usage) and `downloadVerifications` (manages email verification codes)
  - Authenticated users bypass all anonymous restrictions
  - **Development Bypass**: For local testing only, set `VITE_DEV_RECAPTCHA_BYPASS=true` (frontend) and `DEV_RECAPTCHA_BYPASS=true` (backend) as environment variables to skip reCAPTCHA validation. The bypass only works when `NODE_ENV=development` to prevent accidental production usage. Never commit these values to `.env` files.
- **Production Monitoring**: Utilizes Replit Analytics Dashboard and application logs to track HTTP 429 errors, request patterns, and identify problematic IPs. Best practices for monitoring and adjusting thresholds are defined.
- **SEO & Accessibility**: Complete meta tags, sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`, robots.txt, and ARIA labels for accessibility.

### System Design Choices
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM for users, storybooks, purchases, sessions, password_reset_tokens, and admin data. File uploads use Replit Object Storage.
- **Frontend Frameworks**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, TanStack Query, Shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend Frameworks**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM.
- **Route Ordering**: Express routes follow strict ordering - specific routes (e.g., `/api/storybooks/saved`, `/api/storybooks/examples`) must be defined before wildcard routes (e.g., `/api/storybooks/:id`) to prevent incorrect parameter matching.
