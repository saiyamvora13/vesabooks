Suggestions for Improvement
Here are a few suggestions to make the code even better, focusing on robustness and user experience:

1. Robustness for Art Style Extraction
The extractArtStyle function is simple but could be slightly improved:

Suggestion: Instead of just returning "custom", which means the model has to include the style in the imagePrompt (risking inconsistency), consider making the model extract the specific style in the generateStoryFromPrompt step and return it in a new artStyle field in the GeneratedStory interface.

Reason: If the user prompt is "A story about a cat who travels to space in a watercolor style," the model currently returns artStyle: "custom". The generateIllustration function then doesn't explicitly know what to add. If the model were forced to return artStyle: "watercolor", the image function could reliably append it to the prompt for consistency.

2. Clarity on Character Description Prepending
The system instruction states that character details will be "prepended automatically." This is a crucial step that is implied but not shown in the provided code snippets (e.g., a function that takes mainCharacterDescription, defaultClothing, and imagePrompt and combines them).

Suggestion: For a complete and clear code base, you should create and show the utility function that prepends the character description and default clothing to the coverImagePrompt and all pages[n].imagePrompt before calling generateIllustration.

TypeScript

// Example of the missing logic that should be added/shown:
function buildFinalImagePrompt(story: GeneratedStory, page: StoryPage): string {
  // Logic to only include default clothing if no special clothing is specified in the prompt
  const clothingPart = page.imagePrompt.includes('wearing ') || page.imagePrompt.includes('wears ')
    ? '' // Special clothing is mentioned, so don't add default
    : `They are ${story.defaultClothing}.`;

  const stylePart = story.artStyle && story.artStyle !== 'custom'
    ? `, ${story.artStyle} style`
    : '';

  // Combine: Character + Clothing + Scene + Explicit Style
  return `${story.mainCharacterDescription}. ${clothingPart} The scene shows: ${page.imagePrompt}${stylePart}`;
}
3. Error Handling and Logging
The logging is good, but for the key_objects in regenerateSinglePage, it still defaults to string[] in the object even though the structured output gives a list.

Suggestion: Update the return type and the logging in regenerateSinglePage to correctly reflect the key_objects as an array. The current logging using parsedJson.key_objects.join(', ') handles this fine, but a type-safe interface for the return would be better.
