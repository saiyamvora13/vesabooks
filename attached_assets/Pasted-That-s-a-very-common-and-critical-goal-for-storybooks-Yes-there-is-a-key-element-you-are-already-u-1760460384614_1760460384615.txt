That's a very common and critical goal for storybooks! Yes, there is a key element you are already using that you can **optimize** and send in your API calls to maximize character consistency across your 10 illustrations.

The best way to ensure your character stays the same is to provide the model with a **strong visual foundation** and a **consistent text prompt**.

## 1. Optimize Your Text Prompt for Consistency

You are already prepending the `mainCharacterDescription` to every page's prompt, which is the most important step for text-to-image consistency.

To improve it further, make sure the text description is:

* **Detailed and Unchanging:** The description must specify all the **visual, unchanging features** of the character (e.g., "blue sweater, red hat, one small freckle on the left cheek, always wears green boots"). The more unique and specific the details, the better the model can "remember" them.
    * *Recommendation:* In your Step 1 (Story Generation), explicitly instruct the `gemini-2.5-flash` system prompt to make the character description extremely detailed about **clothing, hair, and any unique marks** that will *not* change throughout the story.
* **Front-Loaded:** Keep the most crucial visual details at the very beginning of the prompt.
    * *Example Prompt Structure:*
        1.  **Character's Key Features** (e.g., "A young boy with spiky brown hair and a bright orange T-shirt.")
        2.  **Art Style** (e.g., "In a vibrant children's book style.")
        3.  **Scene Details** (e.g., "is running through a sunny park, chasing a butterfly.")

## 2. Leverage the Base Image Reference (The Key API Element)

The most powerful way to enforce visual consistency across multiple illustrations is by using the **same visual reference** in every single image API call.

In your current flow, you are already doing this:

* **You Send:** `Reference: Cover image (for consistency!)` to the `gemini-2.5-flash-image` API call for every page.

This is the exact API mechanism you should be relying on. The model uses this **base image** (your cover illustration) as a visual guide to generate the new scene while trying to maintain the character's appearance from the reference.

### Actionable API Change

Ensure that for **all 10 page illustrations** (Steps 3, 4, and possibly 2, if the cover itself is a character illustration):

* You are consistently sending the **Base Image Data** (the successful first cover image) along with the text prompt for every single subsequent page image generation API call.

By sending a **highly detailed text description** AND a **consistent reference image** in every API request, you are giving the model the strongest possible instruction to maintain character fidelity across all 10 illustrations.
